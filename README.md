Description

This dataset includes the total number of crimes committed against women in India during the period of ten years (2011â€“2021), broken down by state.This dataset is taken from Kaggle and it contains columns like States, Year, Rape, Kidnap & Abduction, Dowry Deaths, Domestic Violence, Human Trafficking, Assault on Modesty, Sexual Harrassment, Immoral Trafficking and Total Crimes Against Women. Here, The column State contains Union territory and states.
Millions of women worldwide are the worst victims of violence, but only a small number of cases are widely publicised while the most go undetected. Also, incidents of domestic violence, sexual assaults and other similar crimes on women will continuously damage Indian society and obstructs national progress. Therefore, it is important to take proper measures to diminish any kind of violence against Indian women.
Crimes against women are caused by several factors including gender inequality, poverty, patriarchal societal norms, lack of education and awareness,lack of economic independence and weak law enforcement.These reasons create an environment where women are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.
